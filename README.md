**Page Opening**

Upon initial load of the site, you are greeted with a form to search for a city's weather information. Simply type your city into the search bar and select the state or U.S. territory from the dropdown menu, then click on the Submit button. If you have been to our site before and seen weather data, you may choose any of your previously selected cities from the dropdown titled "Your cities list". If this is your first time, don't worry! This dropdown will include your saved cities as soon as you start your search.

**Weather data display**

After using our search function, a successful return will look like this! The largest icon at the top includes the city name, today's date, an icon depicting the weather, as well as the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The next five icons give you all of this same information (except the city name) for your five-day forecast. Units are imperial (U.S. standard).
